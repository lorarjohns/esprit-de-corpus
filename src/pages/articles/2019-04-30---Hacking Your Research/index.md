# Dr. Data: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Chaos



## Everyone Is an Impostor, So Relax

[Impostor syndrome](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud) affects everyone, but especially people starting a new endeavor (like a data science bootcamp...?).



## The Only Way to Improve Is to Get Messy

Here's the truth of the matter: You will never be 'ready' to start.

* You're never going to read all the documentation or exhaust the literature.
* Even if you did, you wouldn't know what's worth retaining and what's not, because you haven't applied it to a real problem.
* You will **not** get it perfect the first time you try it.

[Research says](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxlm0000073) that making mistakes strengthens your learning and recall.

## ...But Make Tactical Messes

If you can't have omniscience, you need something to fall back on when you get stuck. I recommend flexing your research muscles. Give as much care to formulating questions and searching for their answers as you do to your code. Ask yourself:

* Am I asking the **right** question? 
* How did I phrase my question? Could I use other, more specific (or more general) keywords to target the information I need?
* What databases have I checked? (If you've only checked Google and StackExchange, you're not thinking creatively enough.) Where else might this information live?
* How did I query those databases? (If you're only using natural-language searching, you're missing out on a lot.)

# Dr. Data: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Chaos

I am a recovering perfectionist. I jones for total knowledge of a subject before I start an endeavor. I love the high of getting it right on the first try. I get the DTs when I have an unfinished to-do list. I crave the security of feeling like I am in total control of a project.

But we all know that isn't how real life works. For one thing, we have to collaborate, so no one can (or should) have total control over any project. 

## Everyone Is an Impostor, So Relax and Get Messy

[Impostor syndrome](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/11/fraud) affects everyone, but especially people starting a new venture (like a data science bootcamp...?).

Here's the truth of the matter: You will never be 'ready' to start. No one is.

* You're never going to read all the documentation or exhaust the literature.
* Even if you did, you wouldn't know what's worth retaining and what's not, because you haven't applied it to a real problem.
* You will **not** get it perfect the first time you try it.

[Research says](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxlm0000073) that making mistakes strengthens your learning and recall.

## ...But Make Tactical Messes

If you can't have omniscience, you need something to fall back on when you get stuck. I recommend flexing your research muscles. Give as much care to formulating questions and searching for their answers as you do to your code. Ask yourself:

* Am I asking the **right** question? 
* How did I phrase my question? Could I use other, more specific (or more general) keywords to target the information I need?
* What databases have I checked? (If you've only checked Google and StackExchange, you're not thinking creatively enough.) Where else might this information live?
* How did I query those databases? (If you're only using natural-language searching, you're missing out on a lot.)

## Case Study: This Blog

As a Flatiron student, I blog about data science. But where would I host that blog? Wordpress and Squarespace seemed excessive (I like minimalism). Medium is a great, easy platform.

But while I've learned to kick the perfectionist tendencies, I still set the bar high for myself. I expect a lot, and "easy" is seldom the path I want to take.

Part of learning data science is learning to master git and GitHub. So when I learned there was a way to blog using GitHub, how could I resist? 

Using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify](), you can create a static blog, put it in a GitHub repo, and push posts to it from your local repository. I encountered two problems and solved them using the analytical framework I prescribe above.

### Problem 0: GitHub is a Git

### Problem 1: I'm not a web dev

Gatsby is based on React, which I don't know (I'm not a JavaScript guru -- the last time I did front-end web development was in graduate school).

When I first set up my blog from one of the templates I forked on GitHub, I got a lot of weird errors. Many of them came with alarming-looking warnings in the Terminal and had to do with uninstalled dependencies. Rather than panic, 

When I first tried to deploy my blog, I got some weird error messages

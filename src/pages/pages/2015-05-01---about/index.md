Hi, I'm Lora. I'm currently a student at the Flatiron School studying data science. Before I came here, I got a degree in linguistics from Dartmouth College and a J.D. from Yale Law School.
After clerking and practicing for a while as a lawyer, I got my master's degree in library and information science from Simmons University.

That's where I started studying Python, SQL, and database design and management, and realized I could leverage my linguistics background and my law knowledge to do cool things with legal data.

This blog will document my journey through Flatiron School's data science program and hopefully manage to inform and entertain you along the way.

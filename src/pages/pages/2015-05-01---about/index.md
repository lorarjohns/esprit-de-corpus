Hi, I'm Lora. I am a data scientist with a degree in linguistics from Dartmouth College and a J.D. from Yale Law School.
After clerking and practicing for a while as a lawyer, I got my master's degree in library and information science from Simmons University.

That's where I started studying Python, SQL, and database design and management, and realized I could leverage my linguistics background and my law knowledge to do cool things with legal data.
